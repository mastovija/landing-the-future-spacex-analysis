# Landing the Future: A Data Science Analysis of SpaceX Falcon 9

## 📘 Overview

This project is the final capstone for the IBM Applied Data Science Specialization.
It explores SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to discover key factors that influence the success of first-stage landings and builds a machine-learning model capable of predicting landing outcomes.

By understanding these patterns, we gain insight into how SpaceX achieved dramatic cost reductions through reusable rocket technology.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Collect and prepare real-world SpaceX data using API calls and web scraping

- Perform data wrangling to clean and structure the dataset for analysis

- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with both SQL and visualization tools

- Develop interactive analytics using Folium (geospatial) and Plotly Dash (dashboard)

- Build and evaluate machine-learning classification models to predict landing success

## 🧭 Project Workflow

| Step | Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Lab 1 – Data Collection API | Retrieve launch records from the SpaceX REST API using Python requests. |
| 2 | Lab 2 – Data Collection with Web Scraping | Supplement dataset with additional launch details scraped from Wikipedia. |
| 3 | Lab 3 – Data Wrangling | Clean, merge, and preprocess raw data for analysis. Handle missing values and derive new features. |
| 4 | Lab 4 – EDA with SQL | Query the dataset with SQL to summarize launch outcomes and payload patterns. |
| 5 | Lab 5 – EDA with Visualization | Visualize relationships among payload mass, orbit type, and success rate using Matplotlib and Seaborn. |
| 6 | Lab 6 – Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium | Map global launch sites and success frequencies with interactive Folium maps. |
| 7 | Lab 7 – Build an Interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash | Create a dashboard for dynamic filtering and visualization of SpaceX launch performance. |
| 8 | Lab 8 – Machine Learning Prediction | Build and compare classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) to predict landing success. |
