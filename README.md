# Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success


## This repository contains the complete IBM Applied Data Science Capstone project. It explores SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to identify factors influencing first stage landing outcomes and build a machine learning model capable of predicting landing success.

### The project includes:

- Data collection from the SpaceX REST API and Wikipedia

- Data wrangling and cleaning

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization and SQL

- Interactive analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash

- Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN classifiers
