# Landing the Future: A Data Science Analysis of SpaceX Falcon 9

## 📘 Overview

This project is the final capstone for the IBM Applied Data Science Specialization.
It explores SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to discover key factors that influence the success of first-stage landings and builds a machine-learning model capable of predicting landing outcomes.

By understanding these patterns, we gain insight into how SpaceX achieved dramatic cost reductions through reusable rocket technology.
